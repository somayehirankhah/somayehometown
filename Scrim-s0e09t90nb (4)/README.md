Visit Shiraz: The cultural City Website 

Welcome to Shiraz city project! 
This project is a significant milestone in my fitst experience  as a junior frontend developer, created during the Intro to Digital (ITD) course by CodeYourFuture. It's a   my passion start for web development! 

 Project Overview
This one-page website is a vibrant showcase of Shiraz, my hometown. Built with HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript , it's designed to captivate visitors with stunning visuals and engaging content about the Shirazr City.

Features:

HERO SECTION:A welcoming header that introduces culture and sports in this vibrant district close to the center of Shiraz.

ACTIVITIES SECTION: 
Top three activities to do at shiraz.

GUIDE SECTION: A quirky introduction of me:

I have lived at IRAN for over 30 years, so I can show you all of its best parts and hidden secrets.
Personal Touch: Check out my GitHub to see what I'm up to. 

How I start the project?

1-Ensure all points are taken into consideration from Figma Template. â†’ Figma Template from Scrimba

2-Having a materials preparation document where I collect pictures/text information/text font/color to match a better visual communication and coherence in one page.

3-It's important to brainstorm the HTML structure before starting coding, this step helps me save time.

4-Use the "DRY" concept (Don't Repeat Yourself), so that I learn from tailoring the developer's code and learn from it and Scrimba course.

5-To show the completed work between a Web and a template, I prefer refining the CSS code to make sure the project can align the design.


The project consists of the following files:

index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the webpage.

styles.css: The CSS file that provides the visual styling and layout of the page.

Images: A folder containing images used on the page
